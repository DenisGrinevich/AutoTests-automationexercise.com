Hi, this is my first automated testing project using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Maven. 

The project structure and approach were inspired by the [RedRover.school](https://www.linkedin.com/company/redrover-school/posts/?feedView=all) course (Thank them very much).
I automate test cases from the [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com) website using the Page Object Model and various testing tools and best practices. The site has its flaws, so some of the locator designs are not perfect but that's part of the learning process.
I'm also exploring different tools and frameworks to expand my skills and understand how they can improve test automation process.
